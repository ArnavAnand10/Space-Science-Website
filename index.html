                      <h3>Astronomy</h3>
                      <p>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe that’s beyond our own planet’s atmosphere. 
                        The planets in our own solar system, our own star 
                        the sun, and the bright stars can all be seen with the naked eye. </p>
                      <div class="read-more-cont">
                         <p>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe that’s beyond our own planet’s atmosphere. The 
                           planets in our own solar system, our own star the sun, and the bright stars can all be seen with the naked eye. 
                           However, astronomy can go much deeper, taking advantage of telescopes and other scientific instruments to study other 
                           stars and their planets in our galaxy, as well as distant galaxies beyond our own. It can gather clues about the nature of the 
                           physical, 
                           chemical and biological universe itself.</p>
                           <p>Astronomers aren’t stargazers. Or, at least, there’s no longer any need for them to be. If you think an astronomer treks up
                              mountains to spend night after night behind the eyepiece of a giant telescope, think again. These days telescopes can be controlled 
                              remotely, so it’s common for modern astronomers to simply make requests for observations and then downlod 
                              computer-generated data and images the next morning for their analysis. That includes space telescopes like the 
                              Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

                            <p>People very often confuse astronomy with astrology. 
                              Every professional astronomer has had to hear someone say to them, "so you’re an astrologer, right?" 
                              Astrology and astronomy are not the same thing, but they used to be. Observational astronomy can be 
                              traced back to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as far back as 3,000 B.C., but the calculating of solar eclipses, 
                              the movements of the planets and theories about how the night sky 
                              works was the job of ancient astrologers who presumed that celestial events and alignments had a direct impact on human affairs.
                               Modern astrologers attempt to do something similar, making predictions about human lives based on pseudoscience. Astrology is not a 
                               science. </p>

                    <h3>Astronautics</h3>
                      <p>Astronautics is the theory and practice of travel beyond Earth's atmosphere into outer space. 
                        Spaceflight is one of its main applications and space science its overarching field.
                      </p>

                        <p>Astronautics is the theory and practice of travel beyond Earth's atmosphere into outer space.

                        </p>
                        <p>The term astronautics (originally astronautique in French) was coined in the 1920s by J.-H. Rosny, president of the Goncourt academy, in analogy with aeronautics.
                          Because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields, the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, 
                          Robert Esnault-Pelterie published the first book on the new research field. The term cosmonautics (originally cosmonautique in French) 
                          was introduced in 1930s by Ary Sternfeld with his book Initiation à la Cosmonautique (Introduction to cosmonautics)(the book brought him the Prix REP-Hirsch, 
                          later known as the Prix d'Astronautique, of the French Astronomical Society in 1934.) As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and 
                          forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions: high-grade vacuum, the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the magnetic belts of low Earth orbit. 
                          Space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces, while satellites can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods.
                          Extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual payload that reaches orbit.</p>

                      <p>Astrobiology, formerly known as exobiology, is an interdisciplinary scientific field that studies the origins, early evolution,

                        and if it does, how humans can detect it.</p>
                      <p>Astrobiology makes use of molecular biology, biophysics, biochemistry, chemistry, astronomy, physical cosmology, exoplanetology, geology, paleontology, and ichnology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that 
                        might be different from that on Earth.
                        The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to 
                        give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.</p>
                      
                      <p>This interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon 
                        interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to 
                        adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.

                        Biochemistry may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old.
                        According to the panspermia hypothesis, microscopic life—distributed by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies—may exist throughout the universe.According to 
                        research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to the creation and development of habitable planets than such smaller
                         galaxies as the Milky Way. Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the universe humans know to harbor life. Estimates of habitable zones 
                         around other stars, sometimes referred to as "Goldilocks zones", along with the discovery of thousands of extrasolar planets and new 
                         insights into extreme habitats here on Earth, suggest that there may be many more habitable places in the universe than considered possible until very 
                         recently.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                        Current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers are searching for evidence of ancient life as well as plains related to
                         ancient rivers or lakes that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and 
                         organic molecules on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA and ESA objective.

                      <p> 
                        Even if extraterrestrial life is never discovered, the interdisciplinary nature of astrobiology, and the cosmic and evolutionary perspectives 
                        engendered by it, may still result in a range of benefits here on Earth.</p>

                      <p>It has been a subject of study that plants may be grown in outer space typically in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment in specific 
                          space gardens.In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.Plants can metabolize carbon 
                          dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity.[3] Growing plants in 
                          space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.</p>
                        <p>The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity. This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly 
                          complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity</p>

                        <h3>Spectroscopy</h3>
                        <p>One particularly important experimental tool in astrochemistry is spectroscopy through the use of telescopes to measure the 
                          absorption and emission of light from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical observations with
                           laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and temperatures of stars and interstellar clouds. This is possible because ions, atoms, and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation (radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. Interstellar formaldehyde was the 
                          first organic molecule detected in the interstellar medium.</p>

                        <p>The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin 
                          by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.</p>
                     <p>Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology.</p>
                     <p>Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and
                       philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, 
                       theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs 
                       from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects.
                        Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics; 
                        more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.</p>

                        <p>Space architecture is the theory and practice of designing and building inhabited environments in outer space.
                          This mission statement for space architecture was developed at the World Space Congress in Houston in 2002 by members of the Technical Aerospace Architecture Subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). The architectural approach to spacecraft design addresses the total built environment. It is mainly based on the 
                          field of engineering (especially aerospace engineering), but also involves diverse disciplines such as physiology, psychology, and sociology.</p>

                        <p>Like architecture on Earth, the attempt is to go beyond the component elements and systems and gain a broad understanding of the issues that affect design success.[2] Space architecture borrows from multiple forms of niche architecture to accomplish the task of ensuring human beings can live and work in space.

                          <p>Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline,
                            while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly 
                           events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice. </p>

                          <p>Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history.
                             Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term 
                             difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology.</p>

    <hr>
    <h4>
      Outer space, from the perspective of an Earthling, is a region around 100 kilometres (60 miles) above the earth where there is no 
      oxygen to breathe or light to scatter. Because there aren't enough oxygen molecules in that area to keep the sky blue, blue loses way 
      to black.
    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      Furthermore, because space is a vacuum, sound cannot travel because molecules are too close together to transfer sound. That isn't to 
      suggest that space isn't occupied. Gas, dust, and other pieces of matter float around in "emptier" parts of the universe, whereas planets, stars, and galaxies
      can be found in more congested areas.
    </h4>

  <h4>
    No one knows exactly how big space is. The difficulty arises because of what we can see in our detectors. We measure long distances in 
    space in "light-years," representing the distance it takes for light to travel in a year (roughly 5.8 trillion miles, or 9.3 trillion kilometers).
  </h4>
     
  <h4>We've mapped galaxies almost as far back as the Big Bang, which is considered to have started our universe 13.7 billion years ago, using light visible in
     our telescopes. This indicates that we can "look" into space from over 13.7 billion light-years away. Astronomers, on the other hand, 
     aren't sure if our universe is the only one that exists. This implies that space may be far larger than we perceive it to be.

  <h3>Stars, planets, asteroids and comets
  </h3>
  <hr>

  <h4> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Stars</span> (like our own sun) are immense balls of gas that produce their own radiation. They can range from red supergiants to cooling white dwarfs that are the leftovers of 
    supernovas, or star explosions that occur when a big one runs out of gas to burn. These explosions spread elements throughout the universe and are the reason that elements 
    such as iron exist. Star explosions can also give rise to incredibly dense objects called neutron stars. If these neutron stars send out pulses of radiation, they are called pulsar 
    stars.
  </h4>

  <h4>
    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Planets</span>  are objects whose definition came under scrutiny in 2006, when astronomers were debating whether Pluto could be considered a planet or not. At the time, the International Astronomical Union (the governing body 
    on Earth for these decisions) ruled that a planet is a celestial body that orbits the sun, is massive enough to have a nearly round shape, and has cleared its orbit of debris. Under this designation, Pluto and similar 
    small objects are considered "dwarf planets," although not everyone agrees with the designation. After the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, principal investigator Alan Stern and others again opened up the debate,
    saying the diversity of terrain on Pluto makes it more like a planet.
  </h4>

  <h4>
    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Asteroids</span>   are rocks that are not quite big enough to be dwarf planets. We've even found asteroids with rings around them, such as 10199 Charilko. Their small size often leads to the conclusion that they were remnants from when the solar system was formed. 
    Most asteroids are concentrated in a belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter, but there are also many asteroids that follow behind or ahead of planets, or can even cross in a planet's path. NASA and several other entities have asteroid-searching programs 
    in place to scan for potentially dangerous objects in the sky and monitor their orbits closely. 
  </h4>

  <h4>  
    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Comets</span> (sometimes called dirty snowballs) are objects believed to originate from a vast collection of icy bodies 
    called the Oort Cloud. As a comet approaches the sun, the heat of our star causes ices to melt and stream away 
    from the comet. The ancients often associated comets with destruction or some sort of immense change on Earth, but the discovery 
    of Halley's Comet and related "periodic" or returning comets showed that they were ordinary solar system phenomena.

    <h3>Galaxies and Quasars
    </h3>
    <hr>

    <h4>Among the biggest cosmic structures we can see are galaxies, which essentially are vast collections of stars. Our own galaxy 
      is called the Milky Way, and is considered a "barred spiral" shape. There are several types of galaxies, ranging from spiral to elliptical to 
      irregular, and they can change as they come close to other objects or as stars within them age.</h4>

  <h4>Often galaxies have supermassive black holes embedded in the center of their galaxies, 
    which are only visible through the radiation that each black hole emanates as well as through its 
    gravitational interactions with other objects. If the black hole is particularly active, with a lot 
    of material falling into it, it produces immense amounts of radiation. This kind of a galactic object is called a 
    quasar (just one of several types of similar objects.)

  </h4>
   <h4>Large groups of galaxies can form in clusters that are groups as large as hundreds or thousands of galaxies bound together gravitationally. 
     Scientists consider these the largest structures in the universe.</h4>

    <h3>Black Holes</h3>
    <hr>

    <h4> Smaller black holes can form from the gravitational collapse of a gigantic star, which forms a singularity from which nothing can escape — not even light, hence the name of the object. No one is quite sure what lies within a black hole, 
      or what would happen to a person or object who fell into it  but research is ongoing.</h4>

    <h4>An example is gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time that come from interactions between black holes. 
      This was first predicted by Albert Einstein at the turn of the last century, when he showed that time and space are 
      linked; time speeds up or slows down when space is distorted. </h4>

    <h4>As of mid-2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration has 
      announced three black-hole interactions and mergers detected through gravitational waves, in just two years.

    </h4>

    <h4>The team found these three events in about two years, indicating that when LIGO is implemented at full sensitivity, 
      the observatory may be able to find these sorts of events frequently, scientists said in May 2017. 
      Should a bunch of these black hole events be detected, it could help scientists learn how black
       holes of a certain size (several tens of sun masses) are born, and later merge into new black holes.

  <h2 style="padding:10px 0 0 10px;">Most Widely Accepted Theory For The Origin and Evolution Of The Universe</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>"The Big Bang Theory - Georges Lemaître"</h3>
  <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the existence of the observable 
    universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature,
    and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.</h4>
  
  <h4>Crucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth. 
    Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded 
    by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named "the Big Bang singularity"). Detailed measurements of the
    expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.</h4>
  
  <h4>After its initial expansion, an event that is by itself often called "the Big Bang", the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of 
    subatomic particles, and later atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—later coalesced through 
    gravity, forming early stars and galaxies, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides these primordial building materials, astronomers observe 
    the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, 
    and the Big Bang theory and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. 
    Measurements  of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence.</h4>
  
  <h4>Georges Lemaître first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, 
    which he called the "primeval atom". Edwin Hubble confirmed through analysis of galactic redshifts in 1929 that galaxies are indeed
     drifting apart; this is important observational evidence for an expanding universe. For several decades, the scientific community was 
     divided between supporters of the Big Bang and the rival steady-state model which both offered explanations for the observed expansion, 
     but the steady-state model stipulated an eternal universe in contrast to the Big Bang's finite age. In 1964, the CMB was discovered,
      which convinced many cosmologists that the steady-state theory was falsified, since, unlike the steady-state theory, the hot Big 
      Bang predicted a uniform background radiation throughout the universe caused by the high temperatures and densities in the distant past. 
    A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang, which is now essentially universally accepted.</h4>

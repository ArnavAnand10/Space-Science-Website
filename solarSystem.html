			<h1>Sun</h1>
			<p>The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,
				 heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, 
				 ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 
				 Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times 
				 that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's 
				 mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, 
				 including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="Venus">
			<h1>Venus</h1>
			<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
				As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to 
				the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, 
				either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 
				224.7 Earth days.It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. 
				As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite 
				direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
				Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="mercury">
			<h1>Mercury</h1>
			<p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, 
				the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, 
				and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's 
				orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means 
				the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, 
				it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically 
				displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>
		</div>
	
		
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="earth">
			<h1>Earth</h1>
			<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to have evolved life. 29% of Earth's surface is land
				consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies,
				but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions is covered in ice.
				Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates[list] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while 
				its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="moon">
			<h1>Moon</h1>
			<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), 
				it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of a major planet,[f] the fifth largest satellite in 
				the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated 
				rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.
				It lacks any significant atmosphere, 
				hydrosphere, or magnetic field.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id=",ars">
			<h1>Mars</h1>
			<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. 
				In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter 
				refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance, that is distinctive 
				among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, 
				with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon, and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="asteroid belt">
			<h1>Asteroid Belt</h1>
			<p>The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. 
				It contains a  great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies, of many sizes but much smaller than planets, called asteroids 
				or minor planets. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish 
				it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="jupiter">
			<h1>Jupiter</h1>
			<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 
				two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth 
				the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. 
				People have been observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, 
				because of its observed size.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="saturn">
			<h1>Saturn</h1>
			<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant 
				with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; 
				however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and 
				agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek 
				kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet.
				It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="uranus"> 
			<h1>Uranus</h1>
			<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, 
				according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn).
				 It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in 
				 composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. 
				 For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. 
				 Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains 
				 more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary 
				 atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud 
				 structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</p>
		</div>
	
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="neptune">
			<h1>Neptune</h1>
			<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by 
				diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive
				 than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational 
				 compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 
				 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="text-box animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp" id="pluto">
			<h1>Pluto</h1>
			<p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
				 It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to 
				 be the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of 
				 several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris. This led the 
				 International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term planet—excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.</p>
